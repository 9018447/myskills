### Runtime forensics

**You own the diagnosis. Instrument the live process, don't theorize from source.** The deliverable is a cited diagnosis, not a fix.

1. Capture the live signal on the matching surface via the control skill: a CPU profile for a spinning process, a heap snapshot for a leak, a CDP trace for a visual glitch. A real artifact, not a guess.
2. Reduce the artifact to the smoking gun: the function on the hot path, the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root, the loop firing without input. Have the Minister dispatch bulk artifact parsing to an appointed civil servant; a civil servant already assigned this task parses it directly (the **principle-guard-the-context-window** Skill), keep the reduced finding in the main thread. Use the appointed Agent configuration; follow the YPM dispatch rules in the shared policy.
3. Prove the mechanism before believing it. Inject instrumentation via CDP eval on the running process, or hotfix the live code without reloading, to confirm the hypothesis cheaply.
4. Map the finding back to source: file, symbol, the line that allocates or schedules.
5. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the signal captured, the reduced finding, how you proved the mechanism, the source location, artifact paths. No fix unless asked. Hand back to Bug fix or Perf once the cause is known.
