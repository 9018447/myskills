## Tool Routing

Use specialized code search tools instead of shell `grep`/`find` or built-in `Grep`/`Glob`:

- File discovery: `rg --files`
- Content search: `zg` (default) · `zg --rg` (exact text / regex)
- Structural matching: `ast-grep`
- Symbols (definitions, references, types, call hierarchy): LSP
- Graph relations (call chains, dependencies, impact analysis, architecture): `GitNexus`

Escalate from cheap to expensive: `rg --files → zg → ast-grep / LSP → GitNexus`. After locating code, use `Read` on the exact source before concluding or editing.

The full routing policy, including tool boundaries and escalation flows, lives in `.claude/rules/code-search.md`.
